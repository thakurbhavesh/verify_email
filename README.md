# Email Validation Service

## Overview

The service checks syntax, domain validity, SMTP connectivity, mailbox existence, and identifies potential issues such as disposable addresses and honeypots.

## Features

- **Syntax Validation**: Ensures the email format adheres to standard email address formats.
- **DNS MX Lookup**: Checks for valid MX (Mail Exchange) records for the domain.
- **SMTP Server Connection**: Verifies connectivity to the SMTP server for the domain.
- **Mailbox Validation**: Checks if the mailbox exists.
- **Honeypot Check**: Identifies if the email address is associated with known spamtraps.
- **Disposable Address Check**: Detects if the email address is from a disposable email provider.
- **Catch-All Domain Check**: Determines if the domain is a catch-all domain.
